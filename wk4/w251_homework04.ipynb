    "The [Conversation AI](https://conversationai.github.io/) team, a research initiative founded by [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/) and Google (both a part of Alphabet) are working on tools to help improve online conversation. One area of focus is the study of negative online behaviors, like toxic comments (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion).   \n",
    "  \n",
    "Kaggle are currently hosting their [second competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge#description) on this research. The challenge is to create a model that is capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective’s current models. The competitions use a dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall be using this dataset to benchmark a number of ML models. While the focus of the current competition is to mitigate bias, we will not be using the metric used in the competition. Instead we will be focusing on a simpler metric [Area under the Curve (or AUC)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-forum/53782) which is suitable to unbalanced binary datasets. Also, we shall not consider different levels of Toxicity; we shall purely take anything marked over the 0.5 level in the measured toxicity range as toxic, and anything underneath as non-toxic. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a jupyter notbook with some of the tools to model this problem in Deep Learning, using Logistic regression and MLP. Your challenge will be to fill in the models and benchmark the AUC you achieve on these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall be using the keras deep learning package. As you may know, this is an API into DL frameworks, but is most commonly backed by Tensorflow. [keras.io](keras.io) is a great source for documentation and examples on layers available andn functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Have fun!!**\n",
